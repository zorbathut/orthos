* Defensive counterattacks?
* Circles hero

* Place a hidden mine in a random panel of the enemy's area. When the enemy passes over it, it detonates to cause damage. - this is so passive
* Trap effects
* Make a target appear and move around the enemy area. When an enemy is targeted, the satellite will start rapidly shooting a machine gun at the target.
* Make a candle appear in your back row, which constantly recovers your HP as long as it's left undamaged.
* passive buff effects?
* Make an Anubis statue appear, which damages all enemies as long as it's undamaged.

* Stationary
* Barrier - hit once, no damage, absorb, damage limits positive or negative, or other various effects, maybe elemental
