* Figure out what libogg refuses to build with
* Figure out a way to split up defines a bit further - we need lib build flags and extra game build flags
* libpng needs to link to zlib somehow


* Give the UI system a pass
  * Combine text, turn into "wordwrap"
  * Add default sizing 'cause that's a really dang good idea
* Toss all members into some kind of namespace, 'cause, seriously, this is getting stupid
* Toss glorp files into their own directory

* Figure out the basic turn-based format? sure, throw something together
* get the framework for hotseat play
* make a super-basic RPS game, two-player
* extend to generic multiplayer
* set up file system
