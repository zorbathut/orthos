Basic concepts that show up:
* Hitscan weapon
* Thrown weapon
* AOE effects (penetrate, row, column, x, square)
* Elemental effects
* Melee effects
* Attack increases based on damage taken
* Shockwave effects?
* "Make a row of flaming towers appear, damaging any enemies that touch the flames." - wall effects?
* Panel destroyers
* Multishot forward
* Forward, turn to impact enemy (basically a homing device?)
* "A wave moves forward, one row at a time, hitting all enemy panels to cause watery damage."
* "A small electrical ball moves ahead, hitting any enemy that touches it with a strong electric attack."
* Defensive counterattacks?
* Circles hero
* AOE around hero
* "A small snake is released into the enemy area, and whatever enemy that gets hit by it will sustain wood-based damage."
* "Dash straight ahead quickly to attack the enemy, recovering some HP from that attack."
* Player-movement effects
* Vampire effects
* Panel capture
* Shield
* Heal
* Panel crackers - what does that mean in context? Panel reinforcers?
* Enemy stun/disable/transmute
* Repair
* Time bomb - destroy before it explodes
* Make a cloud appear and send it to one of the enemy rows. It will then move north and south, raining on any enemies in the way to cause damage.
* Place a hidden mine in a random panel of the enemy's area. When the enemy passes over it, it detonates to cause damage. - this is so passive
* Trap effects
* Make a target appear and move around the enemy area. When an enemy is targeted, the satellite will start rapidly shooting a machine gun at the target.
* Make a candle appear in your back row, which constantly recovers your HP as long as it's left undamaged.
* passive buff effects?
* Make an Anubis statue appear, which damages all enemies as long as it's undamaged.
* Invulnerability
* Invisibility
* Stationary
* Barrier - hit once, no damage, absorb, damage limits positive or negative, or other various effects, maybe elemental
* All enemies radiate flame? I like effects that hit enemies
* shotgun hitscan, shotgun penetrate?

* categories:
  * damage
  * redirection
  * boost
