You know Mega Man Battle Network? Good game. Interesting battle system. I thought I could improve upon it and make a better game out of it.

It turns out a lot of people think they can do this. They all, with one arguable exception I know of, fail. I was not the exception.

Another mistake I made at the time was writing a 2d library along with my game. Shouldn't have done that. Split my attention too much.

Anyway, here's the barely-started game, with a battle system I never managed to make work. Have fun, I guess!

(I have an idea for how to fix it . . . but, at the moment, no time. Perhaps someday.)
